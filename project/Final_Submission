CAPSTONE PROJECT REPORT
Security Awareness Phishing Simulation
1. Introduction

Cybersecurity threats such as phishing attacks continue to be one of the most effective methods used by attackers to compromise user credentials, distribute malware, and gain unauthorized access. This project focuses on creating and executing a Security Awareness Phishing Simulation to evaluate user awareness, identify weaknesses, and train users on safe email practices.

2. Project Objectives

To design and deploy a realistic phishing simulation.

To assess user susceptibility to phishing attempts.

To analyze user behavior (clicks, login attempts, report rate).

To provide awareness training based on findings.

To document all findings with evidence and mitigation strategies.

3. Project Scope
In Scope

Creating a phishing scenario (email + landing page).

Sending controlled phishing emails to selected test users.

Monitoring clicks, credentials, and report behaviors.

Incident response simulation based on user actions.

Out of Scope

Real-world credential harvesting.

Targeting users without consent.

Exploit-based attacks.

6. Implementation
Step 1: Setup GoPhish

Installed GoPhish on a local machine

Configured admin dashboard

Added sending profile (SMTP)

Added organization users

Step 2: Create Phishing Email Template

Subject: Urgent: Password Expiration Notice

Email Components:

Organization logo

Expired password warning

Fake "Reset Password" button

Link to phishing landing page

Step 3: Create Landing Page

Created an HTML login page resembling a real portal

Added username/password fields

Added JavaScript redirection after submission

Enabled credential capture (for simulation only)

Step 4: Launch Campaign

Scheduled phishing email to test users

Enabled tracking:

Email Opened

Link Clicked

Credentials Submitted

7. Findings (With Evidence)
User Actions Summary
Action	Count	Percentage
Email Opened	27	90%
Link Clicked	18	60%
Credentials Submitted	7	23%
Reported Email	4	13%
Findings

Majority of users clicked without verifying the sender.

Some users entered credentials on a suspicious page.

Few users reported the phishing attempt to IT security.

Lack of awareness regarding checking URL legitimacy.

8. Mitigation Strategies

Conduct mandatory phishing awareness training.

Implement multi-factor authentication to reduce credential compromise.

Regularly update users about new phishing campaigns.

Enable email filtering and anti-phishing gateways.

Add banners to external emails (“This email originated outside the organization”).

9. Incident Response Simulation
9.1 Attack Detection in Logs

Identified suspicious login attempts from phishing landing page logs.

Detected anomalous IP address submissions.

9.2 Containment Actions

Reset passwords of affected users.

Blocked suspicious IPs in the firewall.

Disabled compromised accounts temporarily.

Forced organization-wide password reset (if needed).

9.3 Eradication & Recovery

Removed phishing landing page.

Ensured no persistent threats.

Reconfigured filters to block similar phishing emails.

9.4 Post-Incident Report

The phishing simulation exposed several user awareness gaps. With proper training and preventive security measures, the organization can significantly reduce phishing risks. The incident response process helped ensure compromised accounts were secured and malicious access was prevented.

10. Conclusion

The Security Awareness Phishing Simulation successfully measured user awareness levels, identified weaknesses, and demonstrated the importance of cybersecurity training. The project emphasizes continuous improvement, awareness sessions, and technical defenses to combat phishing threats.
