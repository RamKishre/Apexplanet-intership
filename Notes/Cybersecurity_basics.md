# Basics of cybersecurity

->  [CIA Triad]

1.Confidentiality: Ensures that sensitive information is only accessed by authorized individuals, often using encryption, authentication
                   and access controls to protect data.

2.Integrity: Focuses on maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data by preventing unauthorized modifications or corruption.

3.Availability: Guarantees that systems, networks, and data are accessible to users when needed, even during attacks or failures 
                through redundancy and backups.


->  [Threat Types]


1.Phishing: A social engineering attack where cybercriminals impersonate trusted entities via emails, messages, or websites to steal sensitive information 
           like passwords or financial details.

2.Malware: Harmful software, including viruses, worms, and trojans, that can damage devices, steal data, or provide unauthorized access to attackers.

3.DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): An attack that floods a system or network with massive traffic from multiple compromised devices, making services
                                        unavailable to legitimate users.

4.SQL Injection: A technique where attackers insert malicious SQL commands into input fields to manipulate databases, often extracting or altering sensitive 
                information.

5.Brute Force: An attack method that systematically tries all possible passwords or keys until the correct one is found, exploiting weak or simple authentication.

6.Ransomware: A type of malware that encrypts files or locks systems, then demands payment (often in cryptocurrency) from victims to regain access.


->  [Attack Vectors]


1.Social Engineering: Psychological manipulation where attackers exploit human trust or error, tricking people into revealing confidential information or performing 
                      risky actions.

2.Wireless Attacks: Exploits targeting weaknesses in Wi-Fi networks, such as cracking encryption or intercepting traffic, to gain unauthorized access to systems.

3.Insider Threats: Security risks caused by employees, contractors, or other trusted individuals who misuse their accessâ€”whether intentionally or accidentally to 
                    harm an organization.
