# Cryptographt Basics




-> [ Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption ]

1.Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it fast but requiring secure key sharing (e.g., AES, DES).

2.Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt, enabling secure communication without sharing secret keys (e.g., RSA, ECC).



-> [ Hashing (MD5, SHA256) ]

1.Hashing: A one-way function that converts data into a fixed-length string (hash) that cannot be reversed, commonly used for verifying integrity.

1.1 MD5: An older hashing algorithm that produces a 128-bit hash but is now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities.

1.2 SHA256: A secure hashing algorithm that generates a 256-bit hash, widely used for digital signatures, blockchain, and password storage.



-> [ Digital Certificates & SSL/TLS ]

1.Digital Certificates: Electronic credentials issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) that verify the authenticity of a website, organization, or entity.

2. SSL/TLS: Cryptographic protocols that secure internet communication by encrypting data between clients (like browsers) and servers, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
