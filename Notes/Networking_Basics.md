-> [OSI Model Layers & their Functions]



1.Physical Layer: Handles the physical transmission of raw bits over a medium like cables or radio waves.

1.Data Link Layer: Ensures error detection and reliable delivery of frames between directly connected nodes.

3.Network Layer: Manages logical addressing (IP addresses) and routes data between different networks.

4.Transport Layer: Provides end-to-end communication, error recovery, and data flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).

5.Session Layer: Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.

6.Presentation Layer: Translates data formats, encrypts/decrypts, and compresses data for compatibility.

7.Application Layer: Interfaces directly with end-user applications like web browsers, email, or file transfer.

 
-> [TCP/IP Protocol Suite]



1.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets.

2.IP (Internet Protocol): Provides logical addressing and determines the best route for packets across networks.

3.UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers fast but connectionless data transfer without reliability checks.

4.ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for error reporting and diagnostics, like the ping command.


-> [DNS & HTTP/HTTPS]



1.DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers use.

2.HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): The foundation of web communication, enabling browsers to request and 
        display content from servers.

3.HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect 
        data from eavesdropping and tampering.

4.IP Addressing, Subnetting, and NAT

5.IP Addressing: Assigns a unique identifier (IPv4 or IPv6) to each device on a network so they can communicate.

6.Subnetting: Divides a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks to improve efficiency and security.

7.NAT (Network Address Translation): Maps private IP addresses inside a network to a single public IP for internet 
       access, conserving address space and adding security.
