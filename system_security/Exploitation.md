-> Exploitation & System Security – Term Descriptions

1. Penetration Testing Methodology

A structured step-by-step process used by security testers to identify, exploit, and report vulnerabilities in a system.

Phases

Recon (Reconnaissance):
Collecting information about the target (IP, ports, network info, technologies used).

Scanning:
Using tools to discover open ports, services, vulnerabilities, and system weaknesses.

Exploitation:
Attacking the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control.

Post-Exploitation:
Actions after gaining access — privilege escalation, pivoting, data extraction.

Reporting:
Writing a detailed report containing vulnerabilities, exploits used, risks, and mitigation steps.





2. Exploitation with Metasploit

Metasploit is a powerful framework used to discover, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in systems.

Exploit a known vulnerability in Metasploitable2:
Use Metasploit modules to attack intentionally vulnerable machines like Metasploitable2.

Reverse Shell:
A connection where the victim’s machine connects back to the attacker, giving remote command access.

Post-exploitation commands (sysinfo, hashdump):
Tasks done after the exploit:

sysinfo: shows system information

hashdump: extracts password hashes from the system

3. Password Attacks

Techniques to crack or guess passwords.

Brute-force SSH Login using Hydra:
Hydra tries many username-password combinations until it finds the correct one.

Cracking Hashed Passwords with John the Ripper:
John breaks encrypted password hashes using dictionary or brute-force methods.

4. Social Engineering (Simulation Only)

Using psychological manipulation to trick users into giving sensitive information.

Phishing Email Creation:
Crafting a fake email that looks legitimate to fool users into clicking malicious links.

Awareness Training:
Teaching users how to identify phishing attempts (fake links, suspicious attachments, sender mismatch, etc.).

5. Malware Basics

Fundamental concepts about malicious software.

Static Analysis:
Analyzing malware without running it (looking at code, strings, headers).

Dynamic Analysis:
Analyzing malware by running it inside a controlled sandbox to observe behavior.

Benign Sample in Sandbox:
A harmless program used to understand how malware behaves in a safe environment.

6. System Hardening

Strengthening a system to reduce vulnerabilities.

Apply Security Patches:
Installing updates to fix known security issues in software and operating systems.

Configure Firewall to Block Malicious Traffic:
Creating firewall rules to stop harmful incoming or outgoing network connections.

Disable Unused Services:
Turning off unnecessary services to minimize potential attack surfaces.
